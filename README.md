# netlify-auth-demo

This is a very basic demo for using Netlify's authentication provider service to send a signed request to GitHub's OAuth server and receive an access token in return.

Full setup instructions can be found in the [Netlify OAuth provider docs](https://www.netlify.com/docs/authentication-providers).
